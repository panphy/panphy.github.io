Question,Answer
What does a material's thermal conductivity tell you?,how well it conducts heat
Which materials have low thermal conductivity?,thermal insulators
Give three factors that determine the rate of thermal energy transfer through a material.,"thermal conductivity of material, temperature difference, thickness of material"
What factors affect the rate of heat loss from a building?,"thickness of walls and roof, thermal conductivity of walls and roof, the temperature difference between the two sides of the wall/roof"
Define specific heat capacity.,amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 kg of a material by 1 Â°C
Which two quantities do you need to measure to find the density of a solid or liquid?,mass and volume
What happens to the particles in a substance if its temperature is increased?,they move faster and the energy in their kinetic energy store increases
Why are changes of state physical changes?,no new substances are produced and the substance will have the same properties as before if the change is reversed
Why is the mass of a substance conserved when it changes state?,the number of particles does not change
What is the internal energy of a substance?,the total kinetic energy and potential energy of all the particles in the substance
Why does a graph showing the change in temperature as a substance cools have a flat section when the substance is changing state?,the energy transferred during a change in state causes a change in the internal energy of the substance
What is the name given to the energy transferred when a substance changes state?,latent heat
What is the specific latent heat of a substance?,the energy required to change the state of one kilogram of that substance with no change in temperature
What is the specific latent heat of fusion a substance?,"the energy required to change one kilogram of the substance from solid to liquid at its melting point, without changing its temperature"
What is the specific latent heat of vaporisation of a substance?,"the energy required to change one kilogram of the substance from liquid to vapour at its boiling point, without changing its temperature"
"On a graph of temperature against time for a substance being heated up or cooled down, what do the flat (horizontal) sections show?",the time when the substance is changing state and the temperature is not changing
What property of a gas is related to the average kinetic energy of its particles?,temperature
