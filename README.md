Welcome to the PanPhy Projects. The tools and simulations here are built with AI and designed to be interactive, educational, and align with my teaching goals. While there are many great physics simulations online, not all meet my needs. Additionally, with school devices locked down, installing software has become a hassle. So, I decided to create my own web apps â€“ simple, browser-based, and ready for everyone to explore and enjoy!
