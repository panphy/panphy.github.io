Describe the energy transfer when a moving car slows down.,energy is transferred mechanically from the kinetic store of the car to the thermal store of its brakes. Some energy is dissipated to the thermal store of the surroundings
Describe the energy transfer when an electric kettle is used to heat water.,the electric current in a kettle transfers energy to the heating element’s thermal store – energy is then transferred by heating from the heating element’s thermal store to the thermal store of the water
Describe the energy transfer when a ball is fired using an elastic band.,energy is transferred mechanically from the elastic store of the elastic band to the kinetic store of the band – some energy is dissipated to the thermal store of the surroundings
Describe the energy transfer when a battery powered toy car is used.,energy is transferred electrically from the chemical store of the battery to the kinetic store of the toy car – some energy is dissipated to the thermal store of the surroundings
Describe the energy transfer when a falling apple hits the ground.,energy is transferred from the kinetic store of the apple and dissipated to the thermal store of the surroundings by sound waves

What does a material's thermal conductivity tell you?,how well it conducts heat
Which materials have low thermal conductivity?,thermal insulators
Give three factors that determine the rate of thermal energy transfer through a material.,"thermal conductivity of material, temperature difference, thickness of material"
What factors affect the rate of heat loss from a building?,"thickness of walls and roof, thermal conductivity of walls and roof, the temperature difference between the two sides of the wall/roof"
