Chapter 8,Topic 5,Forces in balance,Paper 2,What is different about the interaction pair when two objects interact?,forces act in opposite directions
Chapter 8,Topic 5,Forces in balance,Paper 2,What is the resultant force if forces on an object are balanced?,zero
Chapter 8,Topic 5,Forces in balance,Paper 2,What is the centre of mass?,the point through which the weight of an object can be considered to act
Chapter 8,Topic 5,Forces in balance,Paper 2,What is the turning effect of a force called?,a moment
Chapter 8,Topic 5,Forces in balance,Paper 2,What about the moments on a balanced object?,sum of clockwise moments = sum of anticlockwise moments

Chapter 8,Topic 5,Forces in balance,Paper 2,What happens to the moment when a small gear drives a large gear?,moment is increased
Chapter 8,Topic 5,Forces in balance,Paper 2,What does Newton’s First Law say?,an object’s velocity changes only if a resultant force acts
Chapter 8,Topic 5,Forces in balance,Paper 2,What is the resultant force on a stationary object?,zero
Chapter 8,Topic 5,Forces in balance,Paper 2,What is the resultant force on an object moving at steady speed in a straight line?,zero
Chapter 8,Topic 5,Forces in balance,Paper 2,What does Newton’s Third Law say?,when two objects interact they exert equal and opposite forces on each other
